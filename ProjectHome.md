### The IR-GTS project is dead. Apologies to everyone who emailed in asking for help, but I simply have too much on my plate, and can no longer commit any time to the project. Thanks to everyone for their contributions -- big and small. ###

## Overview ##
IR-GTS is a Python script that allows users to send and receive individual Pokemon from retail NDS carts using the GTS feature added in Generation IV.

## Black/White Support ##
IR-GTS-BW is now available for download. I have successfully sent and received Pokemon, and the statlog.txt file is being updated correctly. Thanks again to the chaps at Project Pokemon for figuring everything out, and for helping me when I ran into issues.

Notes about IR-GTS-BW:
  * No support for GenIV .pkm files or GenIII .3gpkm files
  * Japanese name parsing has not been implemented. Instead, it uses the PV for the nickname, and 'TRAINER' for the OT name if it detects Japanese characters.
