If the IR-GTS window closes without warning, it's likely encountered an error. If that happens, use these instructions to run the program from a command prompt.

  1. Open your command prompt. For Windows, this can be found in Programs > Accessories > Command Prompt (or just type in 'cmd' into the search box or Run window). On a Mac, open Terminal from /Applications/Utilities.
  1. Use 'cd' to change directories into the ir-gts folder. You can either type the full path to the folder (e.g. 'cd \Users\InfiniteRecursion\ir-gts'), or type 'cd', a space, and then drag the folder into the prompt window and press Enter.
  1. Type '.\ir-gts.py' (Windows) or './ir-gts.py' (Mac). If using the BW version, use ir-gts-bw.py instead. Press Enter and the program will be started normally.
